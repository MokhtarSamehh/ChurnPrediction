# ChurnPrediction

This project uses a classification model to predict customer churn based on a simplified dataset that includes **Age**, **Tenure**, and **Gender**. It also includes a bonus Streamlit web app to interactively test the prediction model.

## Objectives

- Build a predictive model to classify whether a customer will churn.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Deploy a simple web app for user interaction (Bonus).

## Dataset

The dataset used is:  
**`churn_dataset_with_tenure.xlsx`**

It contains:
- Age (Numerical)
- Tenure (Numerical)
- Gender (Categorical: Male/Female)
- Churn (Target: Yes/No)

## Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (for app)
- Excel (for dataset)
